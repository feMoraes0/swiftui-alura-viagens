## Lessons

### Diferences between class and struct:
 - Class:
    - Needs constructor;
    - Reference type:
        - when you have a copy of an class' instance and update data, it will reflect to the original one;
 - Struct:
    - Does not need constructor;
    - Value type:
        - when you have a copy of a struct and update data, it will NOT reflect to the original one;
    - Can't support inheritance;
    - Implements protocols;
    - Has some performance improvements, but class are 'stronger';
    - Uses computed variables;
### Stacks:
    - VStack:
        - vertical stack (y-axis);
    - HStack:
        - horizontal stack (x-axis);
    - ZStack:
        - Z-axis "on top" stack (z-axis);
